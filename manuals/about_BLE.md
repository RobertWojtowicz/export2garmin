### 2.6.2. Troubleshooting BLE adapters
- (*) Bluetooth adapter should have a removable RP-SMA antenna if you want a long range;
- ATS2851 chipset has native support in Debian 12 operating system | Raspberry Pi OS no additional driver needed;
- If you have a lot of bluetooth devices in area, it's a good idea to set an additional check, set ble_adapter_check parameter to "on" in `user/export2garmin.cfg`;
- Script `miscale/miscale_ble.py` has implemented debug mode and recovery mechanisms for bluetooth, you can verify if everything is working properly;
- If you are using a virtual machine, assign bluetooth adapter from tab Hardware > Add: USB device > Use USB Vendor/Device ID > Choose Device: > Passthrough a specific device (tested on Proxmox VE 8-9);
- RTL8761B chipset requires driver (for Raspberry Pi OS skip this step), install Realtek package and restart virtual machine:
```
sudo apt install -y firmware-realtek
sudo reboot
```
- In some cases of **Raspberry Pi** when using internal bluetooth and WiFi:
  - (**) You should connect WiFi on 5GHz, because on 2,4GHz there may be a problem with connection stability (sharing same antenna);
  - (***) WiFi may freeze in 5 version, set switch_wifi_watchdog parameter to "on" in `user/export2garmin.cfg`;
  - If you only use an external BLE adapter, it is recommended to disable internal module `sudo nano /boot/firmware/config.txt` and restart:
  ```
  [all]
  dtoverlay=disable-bt
  ```
  ```
  sudo reboot
  ```

### 2.6.3. Using multiple BLE adapters
- If you are using multiple BLE adapters, select appropriate one by HCI number or MAC address (recommended) and set in `user/export2garmin.cfg` file;
- Use command `sudo hciconfig -a` to locate BLE adapter, and then select type of identification:
	- By HCI number, set parameter "ble_arg_hci";
	- By MAC address, set parameter "ble_arg_hci2mac" to "on" and specify MAC addres in parameter "ble_arg_mac".
- If you are using Omron integration, you must re-pair device with new BLE adapter, see section [2.4.3.](https://github.com/RobertWojtowicz/export2garmin/blob/master/manuals/Omron_BLE.md#243-configuring-scripts)

### 2.6.4. Using two BLE adapters in parallel
- First, you need to complete installation steps for Omron and Xiaomi Body Composition Scale S400;
- Miscale and Omron modules can be activated individually or run together:
	- Devices can run together (Mi Body Composition Scale 2 and Omron without any changes);
	- Devices can run together but there must be a sequence, first measuring blood pressure and then weighing (Xiaomi Body Composition Scale S400 and Omron);<br>
	  This is because Xiaomi Body Composition Scale S400 requires continuous scanning, importing data from scale will allow you to go to Omron module.
	- Devices can run together in parallel but two USB Bluetooth adapters are required, one for scanning Xiaomi Body Composition Scale S400 and other for Omron;
- In this last case, set parameter switch_s400_hci to "on" in `user/export2garmin.cfg`;
- Use command `sudo hciconfig -a` to locate BLE adapter for Xiaomi Body Composition Scale, and then select type of identification:
	- By HCI number, set parameter "s400_arg_hci";
	- By MAC address, set parameter "s400_arg_hci2mac" to "on" and specify MAC addres in parameter "s400_arg_mac".
- From this point on, Xiaomi Body Composition Scale S400 data scanning is done in a separate process and individuall BLE adapter:
